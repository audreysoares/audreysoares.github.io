Have you ever been scared to ask a question in class out of fear of sounding dumb? For all the extroverted, confident people out there, you probably have no idea what I'm talking about. But anyone who was a quiet, shy kid could tell you that they'd much rather walk up to the teacher after class than ask a question in front of everyone that may seem dumb. 

Now, imagine posting that question to an online forum where not only the people in your class can see it, but everyone on the planet that has access to the internet. You'd probably want to make sure that what you're asking isn't a dumb question. 

But what exactly is a dumb question? 

## Dumb Questions

Dumb questions are typically questions in which the answers are obvious. Specifically in the context of coding, dumb questions are questions in which finding the answers are obvious, as long as you're willing to put in a little bit of effort. There are many ways to find the answer to a coding question without asking anyone directly. One could google it, read through FAQs, read source code, etc. 

When posting on a site like Stack Overflow, it's important to remember that you are not entitled to anyone's response. Posting a question that you could have found the answer to with a quick google search is likely to get ignored. An example of such is "How do I print to console in JavaScript." 

## Smart Questions

Smart questions are well thought out, concise, and have relevent subject headers. An example of a smart question clearly states the problem that the user is having, and provides information on what the user has already tried. If someone has responded with the correct solution, then the user should edit their original post to show that their question has been solved, so that someone else with the same problem can refer to their thread rather than making a new one. 

```
Q: What is the purpose of Node.js module.exports and how do you use it?

I can't seem to find any information on this, but it appears to be a rather important part of Node.js as I often see it in source code.

According to the Node.js documentation:
*module

A reference to the current module. In particular module.exports is the same as the exports object. See src/node.js for more information.*

But this doesn't really help.

What exactly does module.exports do, and what would a simple example be?
```

The above question shows that the user tried to find the solution on their own to no avail. They also provide documentation regarding their topic. This question was answered and the user marked the answer as accepted. THis makes it easy for anyone with the same problem to quickly get help.
