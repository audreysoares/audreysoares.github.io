Have you ever been scared to ask a question in class out of fear of sounding dumb? For all the extroverted, confident people out there, you probably have no idea what I'm talking about. But for anyone who was a quiet, shy kid could tell you that they'd much rather walk up to the teacher after class than ask a question in front of everyone that may seem dumb. 

Now, imagine posting that question to an online forum where not only the people in your class can see it, but everyone on the planet that has access to the internet. You'd probably want to make sure that what you're asking isn't a dumb question. 

But what exactly is a dumb question? 

## Dumb Questions

Dumb questions are typically questions in which the answers are obvious. Specifically in the context of coding, dumb questions are questions in which finding the answers are obvious, as long as you're willing to put in a little bit of effort. There are many ways to find the answer to a coding question without asking anyone directly. One could google it, read through FAQs, read source code, etc. 

## In the context of engineering

Ever hear people ragging on engineering companies for delivering late and way over budget? Well, some engineering jobs are really difficult, especially if the requirements and funding are undulating underneath you. Because of the nature of the problem, sometimes engineering firms require large amounts of engineers and workers, inviting further problems and delays.

The Honolulu Rail project at home has become this sort of poster child of failure, budget overrun and overall incompetence in Hawaii. Well, working though regulatory boards and fiscal procedures in Hawaii seems like it's a mind bogglingly difficult job to do. Granted, there might be some fishy stuff going on, but I refuse to believe that everyone is involved for nefarious reasons.

The problem of creating an unprecedented public transportation backbone on an island is difficult! I'm not sure we would have done it right, even if the best people were involved.

## In the context of relationships

So in the end, we realize that all engineering and programming is there for a reason - to serve human needs. Maybe that's why those things are difficult, because they both involve humans and are for humans.

Relationships, regardless if they're romantic or not take work. Humans are fickle creatures and relationships can come and go with the wind. To properly maintain something over time requires work. Family takes work. Marriage takes work. We live to figure out what works and what doesn't and hope that as we move forward we're improving.

Relationships have always been difficult, and by nature will continue to be so.

## Okay!

So back to the original premise; why is being one of the club officers so difficult?

And the final answer - it's supposed to be difficult, and it's supposed to challenge you, just like everything else that humans do that is difficult: programming, engineering, engaging in relationships, pondering the universe, etc.

Ultimately the question you should really ask yourself if something if particularly difficult is then "is it worth it"? That is something that is context specific and only you can answer yourself.
