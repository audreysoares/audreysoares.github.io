My high school, in addition to the Fall and Spring main stage plays, would put on student directed plays. Unlike the main stage plays which were held in the auditorium, these were held in the drama room, which had curtains around the walls, and light fixtures across the ceiling that were controlled by the lighting board. I often light teched for some of these plays. 

This play was Mean Girls the Musical. 

There was a paper next to the light board that mapped some of the main lights used during the current play. Some of the numbered lights on the light board were actually a collection of different lights. For example, if there were multiple scenes that required the same set of lights being turned on, they would be grouped into one number on the light board to make things simpler. 

Every director directs differently. For this specific play, the director gave me the script and let me to whatever. All of the scenes that are just dialogue are straight forward. You put up the lights for the part of the stage that they are standing. But for the musical numbers, there was a blue light and red light to add color.
