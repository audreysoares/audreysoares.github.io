In 2022, a friend of mine reached out to me asking me whether or not I'd be willing to help her with a short film that she was planning to create. I said yes. A couple of months later, she shared an excel spreadsheet with everyone involved that had everything that was needed for the short film. Under the contact tab, I found my name next to the title "Sript Supervisor." I had no idea what a Script Supervisor was. 

## What is a Script Supervisor? 

A Script Supervisor is the person on set in charge with mainting continuity. They take notes on all scenes, commenting on which scenes looked good to the director, which were good for camera crew, and which were good for sound. These notes will untilmately help editing for post production. 

For this project, I was the lead programmer who was responsible for programming the various capabilities of the mouse.  I started by programming the basics, such as sensor polling and motor actuation using interrupts.  From there, I then programmed the basic PD controls for the motors of the mouse.  The PD control the drive so that the mouse would stay centered while traversing the maze and keep the mouse driving straight.  I also programmed basic algorithms used to solve the maze such as a right wall hugger and a left wall hugger algorithm.  From there I worked on a flood-fill algorithm to help the mouse track where it is in the maze, and to map the route it takes.  We finished with the fastest mouse who finished the maze within our college.
